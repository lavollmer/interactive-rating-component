## Overview

This project involved replicating a design layout given for desktop and mobile for a Interactive Rating component with special features.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### My Process

I began by setting up TailwindCSS, ReactJS, and my GitHub repository. Additionally, I configured the README template, added all design assets, integrated Google Fonts, and defined the color scheme. I ensured that all commits were successfully pushed to GitHub before beginning my project.

Next, I reviewed the design layout to determine which sections would be components. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned


### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about TailwindCSS, ReactJS and updating my process of building a website.
